# MULTI-VIEW-GAIT-RECOGNITION-USING-3D-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS

## Introduction
I have written this code for this [research paper](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1304824/1304824.pdf). It uses Keras with Tensorflow as backend. It uses CASIA-B [Dataset](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/Gait%20Databases.asp) to do subject subject\person classification using 3-D Convolution Networks on Gait Silhouette images obtained from the mentioned dataset. I will be adding the images of results and graphs in the coming future as my experiments with this model are completed.

## Main Goal
The objective of the research paper as given above can summarized as :
                              *Creating a model for maintaining view invariance in Gait Analysis*

## Upcoming Updates
* LSTMs (Spatio-Temporal feature extraction)
* SVMs
* with OU-ISIR [Dataset](http://www.am.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/BiometricDB/GaitTM.html)

__IMPORTANT: It is still under development. I will be trying the model with raw video clips instead of provided silhouette images__
